    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a really good, moist Scandinavian cake made in a loaf pan. You can
      put shredded almonds in the bottom of the pan before you pour the mixture
      into pan.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup butter</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons almond extract</li>
      <li>⅔ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a loaf pan with
        wax paper, then spray with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the butter into a heavy saucepan, and melt over medium heat. Allow
        the butter to simmer until foam rises to the top of the butter, 5 to 10
        minutes. Gently skim away the foam and discard; pour the golden, clear
        layer of butter through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl to remove
        remaining milk solids, avoiding pouring any milk solids left in the
        bottom of the pan. Allow the clarified butter to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat sugar and egg with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light
        and fluffy. Beat in the baking powder and almond extract. Stir in the
        clarified butter. Pour in the flour alternately with the cream in 2 or 3
        installments, mixing until just incorporated. Pour batter into prepared
        pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
        comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes before
        removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
      </li>
    </ol>
